      <p>
        Linear search is a simple search algorithm that finds the position of a
        target value within an array.
      </p>
      <p>
        It sequentially checks each element of the array until a match is found
        or the whole array has been searched.
      </p>
      <p>
        Linear search has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the number of
        elements in the array.
      </p>
      
    </div>
